# BlockTweaks
Changes blocking aspects in Valheim

## What and why?
Some blocking stuff really got annoying like pushing back the enemy when deflecting an attack or that blocking is totally ignored 
when the damage exceeds your block armor and the exceeding damage fills your stagger treshold.

This mod removes at least this two things.

## Config settings
### Section Debug
#### writeDebug
Set a boolean value (true | false) to write debug messages

### Section General
#### Remove Deflection force
Set a boolean value if enemies are shoven back when deflecting the attack with a weapon or shield

#### Ignore BlockArmor exceeding Damage
Set a boolean value if blocking should happen even when the damage exceeds your block armor and the exceeding damage fills your stagger threshold.
